    Hello curious visitor.
    I hope you are delighted to find nothing special here.
    This site was hand-coded by me and consists of only plain HTML and CSS.
    There is no tracking, no Javascript, no server generating pages. Only some
    statically served files. I don't know who you are or even that you are here.
    I believe that is how the internet should be... simple, fast, and not creepy.

    You can see the source code for this site on my github profile:
    https://github.com/dewaldreynecke

    Cheers!
    Dewald

    <h3>Wait, what... why?</h3>
    <p>
      The seeds.rb file in Rails is a very convenient way to fill your
      database with false/test information during development. In building the
      application that powers this very blog I filled it with dozens of posts
      to help me style the pages while viewing actual (fake) content.
    </p>
    <p>
      That is in <em>Development</em> though — as soon as you send it to
      <em>Test</em>, or <em>Production</em> you probably don't want that same
      content to appear in the database. Easy enough you might think... just
      do not seed the database in <em>Production</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, yes, but with a small change in your code you can easily create
      separate seed files for each environment. Now you'll have the opportunity
      to write a separate seed for <em>Development</em>, creating hundreds of
      entries, and maybe something else — shorter typically — for <em>Production</em>.
    </p>
    <h3>How</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Create a seeds folder</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Inside your application's <code class="inline-code">db/</code> folder,
      create a subfolder <code class="inline-code">seeds</code>.
    </p>
    <pre><code>mkdir db/seeds/ && cd db/seeds/</code></pre>
    <p>
      <strong>Create a seed file for each environment</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Create a new (empty, for now) file for each environment in your new
      <code class="inline-code">seeds/</code> folder.
    </p>
    <pre><code>touch development.rb test.rb production.rb</code></pre>
    <p>
      <strong>Set up seeds.rb to run the appropriate seed</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Edit your main <code class="inline-code">seeds.rb</code> file to look as follows:
    </p>
      <pre><code>puts "Starting database seed."
puts "Current environment is: #{Rails.env.downcase}"
load(Rails.root.join('db', 'seeds', "#{Rails.env.downcase}.rb"))

# Do not add any seed command to this file. Instead, go to /db/seeds/ where you will find:
# development.rb
# production.rb
# test.rb
# Add your seed code into one of those depending on the environment where you wish for it to execute.</code></pre>
    <p>
      The third line (starting with <em>load</em>) will ensure that the
      appropriate seed file, from those three we created, gets executed wherever
      <code class="inline-code">rails db:seed</code> is run.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Now seed!</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      All that remains is for you to add your desired seed code to any one of
      the new seed files and it will execute in the appropriate environment.
      You'll probably want to start in <code class="inline-code">development.rb</code>
      and test it locally.
    </p>
    <h3>Rails templates</h3>
    <p>
      If you want the above to happen automatically when creating your new Rails
      application you might want to have a look at (and use, or copy) my Rails
      templates. <a href="https://github.com/dewaldreynecke/rails-templates" target="_blank">
