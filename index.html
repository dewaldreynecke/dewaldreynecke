    Hello curious visitor.
    I hope you are delighted to find nothing special here.
    This site was hand-coded by me and consists of only plain HTML and CSS.
    There is no tracking, no Javascript, no server. Only some statically served
    files. I don't know who you are or even that you are here. I believe that is
    how the internet should be... simple, fast, and not creepy.
    Cheers!
    Dewald

        <h2>What I do</h2>
        <p>
          I build custom software solutions for small and medium companies. Why?
          With modern tooling it is possible for a single developer to build fully
          functional applications that deliver a lot of value. That brings the cost
          down to reasonable levels where smaller companies (or sole entrepeneurs!)
          can afford it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Using my years of experience analysing and improving internal workflows,
          combined with with my code writing expertise I will help your small
          business operate more smoothly and easily.

        <h2>Why choose me to do it for you</h2>
        <ul class="reasons">
          <li class="shadow border-rounded">
            <h3>Confidentiality</h3>
            <p>
              I strongly believe that your information is yours alone, so will not
              be sharing anything I may see or learn at your business with anyone.
              That is also why this website contains no tracking or analytics.

          <li class="shadow border-rounded">
            <h3>Business before code</h3>
            <p>
              Thoroughly understanding the business requirements and necessary
              outcomes before writing the first line of code leads to better
              outcomes. Using my experience analysing workflows and my project
              managment training I will ensure the right things happen. Though I
              like writing code it is not the primary goal of our engagement.
            </p>

          <li class="shadow border-rounded">
            <h3>Clean simple code</h3>
            <p>
              Software lives on and will invitably have to be maintained. Whether
              it turns out to be me or someone else, they will benefit from the
              simply structured and well documented project I put together, easing
              the maintance burden and cost.

        <h2>How I work</h2>
        <p>
          To address the unmet expectations and overruns that so often plague
          software projects we will fix the scope through agreement on
          expected outcomes at handover, along with a fixed price.
        </p>
        <p>
          You are protected from cost overruns typical with hourly billing and we
          are both incentivised to keep the scope and timeline in check.
        </p>
        <p>
          User training will complete phase 1.
        </p>
        <p>
          After the initial build we can enter another phase to address the
          additional requirements that became clear during the build, if any.
        </p>

        <h2>Sample projects and previous work</h2>
        <p>
          Unfortunately due to the, often internal, nature of my typical projects
          I can usually not share much. Here are some anonymised examples.
