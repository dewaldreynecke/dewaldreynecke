    Hello curious visitor.
    I hope you are delighted to find nothing special here.
    This site was hand-coded by me and consists of only plain HTML and CSS.
    There is no tracking, no Javascript, no server generating pages. Only some
    statically served files. I don't know who you are or even that you are here.
    I believe that is how the internet should be... simple, fast, and not creepy.

    You can see the source code for this site on my github profile:
    https://github.com/dewaldreynecke

    Cheers!
    Dewald

      Struggling with having to update your menu in many places? Endlessly
      resending reports and looking for old emails? Need a loyalty program for
      your small neighbourhood business? Have some old data from a legacy system
      that your staff needs to access more easily? Still using paper forms that
      should rather be electronic?

      <h2>Why choose me?</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="mt-block">
      <h3 class="mt-block-workaround">Business before code</h3>
      <p>
        Thoroughly understanding the business requirements and necessary
        outcomes before writing the first line of code leads to better
        outcomes. Using my experience analysing workflows, and my project
        managment training, I will ensure the right things happen. Though I
        like writing code it is not the primary goal of our engagement â€” getting
        the envisioned results for your business is more important.
      </p>
      <h3>I see the big picture</h3>
      <p>
        ... but still relish in the details.
      </p>
      <h3>Confidentiality</h3>
      <p>
        I strongly believe that your information is yours alone, so will not
        be sharing anything I may see or learn at your business with anyone.
        That is also why this website contains no tracking or analytics.
      </p>
      <h3>Clean simple code</h3>
      <p>
        Software lives on and will inevitably have to be maintained. Whether
        it turns out to be me or someone else, they will benefit from the
        simply structured and well documented project I put together, easing
        the maintenance burden and cost.
      </p>
      <h3>Clear communication</h3>
      <p>
        Through years of managing projects I have learned the value of clear
        communication. Working with me you will always know what I'm doing, why,
        and how. I won't hide problems or challenges and you'll know what to
        expect.

    <div class="mt-block">
      <p class="mt-block-workaround">
        To address the unmet expectations and overruns that so often plague
        software projects we will fix the scope through agreement on
        expected outcomes at handover, along with a fixed price.
      </p>
      <p>
        You are protected from cost overruns typically associated with hourly
        billing and we are both incentivised to keep the scope and timeline in
        check. I take the risk of time overruns, sparing you that uncertainty
        in the budget.
      </p>
      <p>
        User training will complete the first phase.
      </p>
      <p>
        After the initial build we can enter another phase to address the
        additional requirements that became clear, nice-to-have features, and
        so on.
      </p>
      <p>
        This approach ensures we all know where we stand. The software is
        always in working order, and you benefit from continued and regular
        progress.
