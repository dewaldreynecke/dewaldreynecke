    Hello curious visitor.
    I hope you are delighted to find nothing special here.
    This site was hand-coded by me and consists of only plain HTML and CSS.
    There is no tracking, no Javascript, no server generating pages. Only some
    statically served files. I don't know who you are or even that you are here.
    I believe that is how the internet should be... simple, fast, and not creepy.

    You can see the source code for this site on my github profile:
    https://github.com/dewaldreynecke

    Cheers!
    Dewald

    <h1>Technology</h1>
    <p>
      This is on a separate page because I think it is less relevant than
      the business value we will set out to create together. It is after all more
      important that your website allows a customer to login and see their
      documents, for example, than whether that website is powered by Javascript
      or Ruby.
    </p>
    <p>
      That said, its still of interest and the technology choices will have an
      impact on the future maintainability and ease of expansion of your
      application. Though we probably start out building a web application it is
      prudent to also lay a good groudwork for expanding to smartphones apps â€“
      in many cases those will be a logical second phase.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lastly, there is productivity to keep in mind. There is only one of me and
      I need to use languages and frameworks that enable a single developer to
      easily create an entire application in a reasonable time.
    </p>
    <h3>With all of that considered, here are the technologies I default to:</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Frontend:</strong>
      HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript. Javascript often with the Stimulus framework.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Backend:</strong>
      Ruby on Rails
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Database:</strong>
      PostgreSQL
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Hosting:</strong>
      Up to the customer, but lacking a strong preference, Heroku.
